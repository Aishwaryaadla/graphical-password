# üîê Graphical Password Authentication System

A secure and user-friendly authentication system that replaces traditional text-based passwords with image-based login. This project allows users to set and verify passwords using images or specific click points, enhancing both usability and security.

## About

The **Graphical Password Authentication System** is built to offer a more intuitive and secure alternative to traditional password systems. Instead of remembering complex alphanumeric passwords, users authenticate by selecting a sequence of images or clicking specific points on a single image.

This approach makes it harder for attackers to guess or brute-force credentials and is especially useful for systems targeting non-technical users, children, or visually-oriented environments like schools, kiosks, or internal tools.

## How It Works

1. **Registration**: User selects multiple points on an image (or image sequence).  
2. **Storage**: Coordinates or selected images are securely stored .  
3. **Login**: User clicks the same points or selects the same images in the correct order.  
4. **Validation**: System compares login pattern with stored one and grants access.
